<!-- <h2>Online Notary</h2>
        <p>Get your document notarized from your home computer!</p>
        <p>From coast to coast, countless clients are benefiting from this fairly new service. Do
            you
            need
            a document or more notarized? As long as you have a strong internet you can choose to have notarizations
            done
            online. Especially in our new world climate, sometimes going out is not convenient or may not be safe.
            All
            sessions are recorded on a secure site to meet State requirements. You will answer some knowledge based
            questions and then upload your documents. This can be scheduled for your convenience, not only during
            "Business
            Hours". Reserve your time slot to get your notarization done! Prices are $25 per Notarial act.</p>

        <h2>Certified Apostille Service</h2>
        <p>The Knowledge and ability to quickly get your documents Apostilled or
            legalized/Authenticated
            for any foreign country.</p>
        <p>An Apostille is a certification of signatures on a document that is going to be used
            in a
            foreign country that has joined or contracted with the October 5th, 1961 Hague Convention. If the
            Country of
            destination does not belong to the Hague Convention they are known as Non Hague Countries and the
            process is
            much more involved and their fee's change drastically. </p>
        <p>You know the old adage you don't know what you don't know. Well trying to complete
            the
            documents for any Authentication or Apostille is confusing and takes so much time. Maybe you are
            adopting a
            child, having a destination wedding, going to study or work in a foreign country. One misstep and you
            have
            to
            start all over and you do not get your money back. Save yourself the frustration, time, hassle and
            confusion
            Let
            us cut through all the red tape for you!</p>
        <p>We offer both standard and expedited Apostille/Authentication. </p>
        <p>For expedited we hand walk your paperwork through. (unfortunately with Covid-19 some
            States
            and Federal Agencies are still not working with a full crew and we may only be able to drop box expedite
            VS
            a
            walk through. However that is still faster then just a mail in request.</p>
        <p>We work with individuals and with Business accounts. Feel free to call, text or
            email. Or
            fill out the request form. Please know that by filling out the order and uploading the documents will
            only
            start
            an estimate for you. It would also show us if the documents are complete and ready for authentication.
            We
            value
            your privacy and trust. First and foremost as Notary Public's our job is to protect our clients and
            their
            information. Everything is confidential.</p> -->
