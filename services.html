                        <h3>Exceptional Service and Standards</h3>
                        <p>My goal is to make getting something Notarized or Apostilled as simple and
                            convenient
                            for
                            you that I can! Whether that service is online or in person, my mission is to make
                            sure
                            you get
                            it.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Exceptional Communication</h3>
                        <p>Exceptional communication is what I strive for. For some clients that is daily
                            communication, for others it is "let me know when it is completed" Either way know
                            that
                            I never
                            assume,
                            I
                            will
                            always ask.</p>

                                    Most Attorney's have an in house Notary, but there are always times when it is
                                    after
                                    or
                                    before their hours of availability. Or maybe their Notary is on vacation. Let us
                                    know
                                    how we

                                It can be so frustrating. You need a Notary, which used to be so easy to find at
                                your
                                local
                                Bank. Not any more. Most Banks will only Notarize their own documents, if they
                                even
                                do
                                that.
                                Being a Mobile Notary Public allows me to come to you. Or we can meet somewhere,
                                for
                                instance a coffee shop, DMV, Hospital etc. There is no reason for you to drive
                                to
                                try
                                and
                                find a Notary. I am here when you need me!</p>
